To use this code, you need to have installed the packages YALMIP and SeDuMi (or
another SDP solver of your choice). You can get these from:

https://yalmip.github.io/download/
https://github.com/sqlp/sedumi

You can run setup.m (with the paths appropriately modified) to load the packages.

To reproduce the figure from section III.E (Numerical Results), run
the script main.m
